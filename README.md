Sudoku
======

My first program in Haskell solves a Sudoku puzzle. To run it, call `$ cabal run path/to/puzzle`, where the puzzle file is in the format:

```
8..4.6..7
......4..
.1....65.
5.9.3.78.
....7....
.48.2.1.3
.52....9.
..1......
3..9.2..5
```

Each line represents a row in the Sudoku puzzle.
